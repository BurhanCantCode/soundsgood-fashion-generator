# DressUp: Your Personal Styling Assistant

## Overview

**DressUp** is a revolutionary styling assistant app designed to help individuals find their perfect look. Many people feel overwhelmed by fashion choices and seek a simple, responsible way to curate their wardrobe. DressUp addresses this need by considering both individual physical traits (like skin tone, eye color, and body shape) and social traits (such as desired self-image and how they want to be perceived) to offer personalized style recommendations.

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: DressUp gathers data on an individual's traits, habits, and preferences.
2. **AI-Generated Sketches**: Using AI, it generates sketches of potential looks to help the individual visualize their new image.
3. **Future Integration**: We plan to integrate with local store inventories to suggest and locate available clothing items for immediate purchase.

This unique combination of personalization, convenience, and creativity makes DressUp an essential tool for anyone looking to enhance their appearance while staying true to their inner nature.
